Data centers
Virtualization
Internet access
CDN
Resource allocation --> Orchestration --> Kubernetes
Security & multi-tenancy --> Vnet, access control (security) to provide isolation during multi-tenancy 
Scalability & automation --> auto scale up and down based on needs


Cloud Service Providers
=======================
MS Azure, AWS, GCP, Oracle, Bluehost

Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS) --> Servers, Virtual Machines, Virtual network

Software As A Service --> Ready to use software/apps that are hosted on cloud [Gmail,CRM,ERP, Office 365]

Platform As A Service --> Provides a platform to build, test and deploy apps (Azure app service, Google playstore) 

Networking As A Service --> AWS direct connect, AZ networking

ID As A Service --> SOS, Multi factor authentication, (AZ Active Directory[Entra ID], AWS IAM)

Deployment Models
=================
Public cloud --> Shared by multiple Organisations 
Private cloud --> Private to a Organisation/individual
Hybrid cloud --> Combination of private and public cloud
Multi-cloud --> Combination of services from different cloud providers (vm-->azure, Storage-->aws, analytics-->gcp)
Community cloud --> Shared infrastructure with multiple organisations with similar needs

Services
========

1. Compute Services --> Virtual machines, App service, AKS, Functions

2. Networking --> Vnet, Load balancer, VPN gateway, DNS

3. Storage --> Blob, Files, Disk, Queue & table

4. Database --> SQL, Cosmos, Mysql/postgresql

5. Security --> AAD (Entra ID), Key-vault, Defender

6. AI & Analytics --> ML, Synapse, Cognitive servics, Vision, OpenAI, ADF

7. Devops --> CI/CD pipelines, code repo, agile tools, monitor, application insights


Virtual Machines
================

VM is a virtual computer with hardware/software etc.

Isolation
Internet communication
Traffic filtering
on-premise connectivity

OSI layers
==========
Application layer --> Human -- computer interaction
Presentation layer --> Ensures that the data is in a usable format and is where the data encryption 
Session layer --> Maintains the connections and is responsible for controlling the ports and sessions 
Transport --> Transmits the data using tracsaction protocols TCP and UDP
Network --> Decides which physical path the data follows
Data link --> Defines the format of data on the network
Physical --> Transmits the raw bit of the data streams over physical medium

Socket --> IP + Port
HTTP --> 80
SSH --> 22
HTTPs --> 443

Azure bastion --> Used to SSH/connect to yout VM without a public IP address --> Paid service


Virtual network
===============

Azure Vnet
==========

Acts as a Communication channel between the resources launched in the cloud, it is a representation of your own network in the cloud,
logical isolation of azure cloud dedicated to your subscription 

Subnet --> A Sub network
Route tables --> To control the flow of network traffic within a virtual network
Network Security Group --> Firewall, responsible for filtering incoming, outgoing traffic from/to your VM
Network Interface Card --> Enable communication between VM's over a network


IP Addresses
============

Internet protocol --> Unique numerical address

Public --> Globally unique, accessible from the internet 
Private --> Local network, not accessible from internet
Static IP --> Manually assigned, remains constant
Dynamic IP --> Automatically assigned, changes periodically

IPV4 (32 bit) --> 4 decimal numbers --> ranging between 0 and 255 (192.168.1.0) --> 2**32
IPV6 (128 bit) --> 2**128

-,-,-,-

0-255,0-255,0-255,0-255

0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255

CIDR --> Classless Inter Domain Routing
=======================================
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255 = 256 unique addresses --> 192.168.0.0/24
192.168.0.0, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2, 192.168.0.3 ..........192.168.0.255 

192.170.0.0/16 --> 192.170.0.0--192.170.255.255 --> 256*256 unique addresses
192.170.0.1 -- 192.170.0.255
192.170.1.0--> 192.170.255.255

192.0.0.0/8 --> 256*256*256
